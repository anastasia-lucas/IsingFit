Network estimation using the eLasso method
}
\description{
This network estimation procedure eLasso, which is based on the Ising model, combines l1-regularized logistic regression with model selection based on the Extended Bayesian Information Criterion (EBIC). EBIC is a fit measure that identifies relevant relationships between variables. The resulting network consists of variables as nodes and relevant relationships as edges. Can deal with binary or continuous data.
