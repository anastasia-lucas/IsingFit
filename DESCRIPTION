Description: This network estimation procedure eLasso, which is based on the 
    Ising model, combines l1-regularized logistic regression with model selection 
    based on the Extended Bayesian Information Criterion (EBIC). EBIC is a fit 
    measure that identifies relevant relationships between variables. The resulting 
    network consists of variables as nodes and relevant relationships as edges. Can 
    deal with binary data. Citations for methods used in the package: Chen, J., &
